# MI-Proj-B/M: Group T4 

**Description:**  
This repository contains the submissions of our university project on the topic of "Modern Web Development with JavaScript." The goal of the project is to learn and practically apply modern web technologies. We use various technologies from the JavaScript ecosystem, including Webpack, Babel, React, ESLint, Firebase, and more.

The project consists of several parts, each focusing on specific concepts and tools. In the final part, the previously learned technologies are combined to develop a comprehensive web application.
